I found a quarter in Black Rock City.

How explain the pointless shape?  
It’s must be circle guide.  

But how explain the ridged edge?  
It’s must be machine cog.

But how explain the detailed emboss?  
It must be pressing stamp.

But how explain the second side?  
It must be reused scrap.

But how explain the date and signature?  
It must be gifted toy.

But how explain the plain color?  
It must be cheaply mass produced.

But no producer would produce a product minus object.

Now i see  
Its irony.
