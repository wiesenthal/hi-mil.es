# You do not know what you are talking about.

If you think you do, first ask yourself these three questions:

1. What is information?

2. What is stuff?

3. What is "you"?

If you have a good answer to any of these questions, I'd love to hear it.

And if you connect the dots from the foundations to explain the whole present circumstance of compounding material, financial, social, emotional and ever-unfolding intricacies I am sure you experience, without logical contradiction, I'd give you a pat on the back.

Importantly, If what I'm saying makes you feel indignant or helpless, remember, I don't know what I am talking about either.

And when other people intellectually intimidate you, when you feel like an imposter in the world and supress yourself, just remember that nobody at all knows what in the hell we are all talking about.
