# Epistemic Urgency Distinguishes Human Slop from AI Slop

There is a difference between content written by a human and content written by an LLM.

What is it?

It is not necessarily the _quality_ of the writing. Some debate that there will always be a creative element that is essential to human writing which LLMs can never truly replicate.

I have not heard a logical argument for why this is the case, and I see no reason to believe it, other than as a soothing mechanism for fear of human redundancy.

For a given instruction, e.g. "write a book about orchids", it's likely that today's LLMs will produce a better book than the average human, and tomorrow's LLMs a better book than the leading human orchid expert.

No, the difference I notice is an epistemic one, not a qualitative one.

##### _Epistemic: relating to knowledge or the process of knowing._

That is - knowledge created by an LLM is not urgent, whereas knowledge created by a human is urgent to the moment it is created.

Let me explain.
