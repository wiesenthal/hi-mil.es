# The Archer

The archer shoots arrow after arrow. Each arrow whizzes by the target. Rarely, one thunks deep in the straw of the target. The bulls-eye is naked from holes.

Others judge the archer for failing to hit the bulls-eye. Instead arrows scatter in the forest.

The archer succeeds by scattering arrows in the forest.
