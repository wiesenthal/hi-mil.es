        <b>Don&apos;t mention the elephant in the room.</b>
        Let the subconscious mind flow and guide my hands as they type on the
        keyboard. Slightly oily, slightly dusty, the keys pass beneath my
        fingers, the screen glares at me with its Pollockian streaking. Voices
        of Rick Rubin and Andrew Huberman chatter like squirrels in my ears,
        overriding my conscious thought. The only abject abstraction is created
        by my subconscious mind as my mind blurs. Can I describe more than what
        I experience? No? No! No! No ! Yes???? Oh god I&apos;ve begun to loop so
        I regained some control. My fingers miss as I panic. I have no
        creativity. I am echoing hollow words. I want to listen to these people
        talk, wise men. So I limit the energy entering these words. It&apos;s
        almost like I don&apos;t know I can&apos;t even care to put any
        substance into this. Should I take notes on this? I don&apos;t
        particularly find anything said so far to be novel, having read Rick
        Rubin&apos;s book. Interesting thoughts on doing things “my way”. This
        is nonsense. There&apos;s no value to this. The self-fulfilling
        prophecy. It&apos;s a downward spiral. Is it an expression to the
        direction of juicing it out? Or will spiraling only deepen the spiral,
        deepen the grooves, lubricate the slippery slope? Can I simply spend my
        time looping on the abject absurdity of the condition of writing right
        now? To create what is completely meaningless, reinforced by its
        obsession with constant reminding of itself of its own total impotence?
        To deny any semblance of illusion, to reject immersion and suspension of
        disbelief. I cannot make any progress at all. I am stuck at the very
        beginning, before having said anything at all, never able to step
        forward because of the reflection and assertion that there is no
        forward, that nothing I write has value or could have value and
        therefore to never attempt to create value or the illusion of meaning.
        Why would I? Rick is talking. We know nothing. See I could just write
        and write and write.I find it interesting to ask whether I should write
        about me writing or to write about you reading. For you, you&apos;re
        reading. My writing of this is kind of a fiction… How can it be? The
        whole book is already written! I can tell you that this line now is the
        latest line, and there is nothing that comes after it. But even now as I
        read it back it is false. For you the reader, you are reading. I wonder
        what kind of mental imagery is unfolding. Probably not much. After all,
        there&apos;s nothing I&apos;m talking about or referring to. This is
        getting boring to write. I can only imagine how boring it is reading it.
        To read it and to know that you are gaining nothing, learning nothing. I
        think I could say the same about any text. That your whole life is just
        a dream. You&apos;re never higher or lower, better or worse than you are
        now. These words yes declare their emptiness, but they can only do as
        such and be correct as such because all words are empty. Surface
        texture, with nothing below. Keep em yapping right. I don&apos;t
        won&apos;t to repeat myself. I want to impress perhaps some lasting
        philosophical understanding beyond a declaration of precepts, but by
        boring into your mind the blankness of meaning perhaps it can sink in
        deeper. Funnily enough that only plays into the illusion. The cosmic
        joke of it all manifests. Even in this exercise of exerting utter
        nonsense, the ego writer still wants to have an effect, a purpose for
        writing. I have to face the complete valuelessness of these words. I
        cannot expect anyone to desire to read this or to continue reading at
        any point. By all measures if I succeed at my goal (which is to lack the
        essence of goal-having: purpose), then this is a truly fruitless
        exercise. I suppose I can hope it is expression of an energy, perhaps
        this kind of destructive energy which I find myself to possess. But
        again, I don&apos;t even know if this is just a further descent into the
        abyss, for every step I take (of not taking) I only add to my confusion
        of soul. And later, to enjoy enlightenment, I must undo this current
        false-effort by stretches of Good spirituality in meditation. Am I just
        feeding the thought-addiction we all face? Buying into the idea that in
        order to exist I must think and write, compounding the destruction with
        self-denigration by declaring that I do exist as a self and I have no
        value? I don&apos;t see an end in sight. I don&apos;t think there will
        be some moment at which I reach a tipping point, absolute zero, and
        everything snaps into alignment. See I&apos;ve even lost the train of
        the telescoping meaninglessness. I think beforehand in this writing I
        was able to scratch at something elusive, causing it to elude me further
        engaging in quite a funny dance. But now I feel more as if I&apos;m
        simply making lateral movements. I seem to have so quickly forgotten
        that I never was making progress, although I can&apos;t shake the sense
        that I had been making progress in expressing the utter nonexistence of
        my progress, as if the fruitlessness of my effort had been fruiting. I
        have some satisfaction now at regaining the thread. I will transition
        yet again to the reader&apos;s perspective. Less true as it is for me,
        luckily I cannot be less true than Falsehood which I am embodying. So,
        you, reading this. I cannot guarantee this will be read. Chances are it
        will not. Stop reading this. I can command you so. Do not read further.
        I hereby doubt the existence of you the reader. You, reading this, you
        aren&apos;t here. There&apos;s nothing real about you. The reader is a
        fiction. Prove me wrong, reader. You can&apos;t, because you&apos;re not
        even here to be reading this. How do you know that you are reading?
        Aren&apos;t there just the words? Is reading the process of translating
        words to meaning? First of all, there is no reader to be reading and
        performing this process, second of all, whatever appears simply appears
        spontaneously, with no subject to perform anything, and thirdly,
        there&apos;s no meaning to transform into in this supposed process of
        words &gt; meaning. So, you lose, reader. You fiction, you. I don&apos;t
        care about you. Why would I? You&apos;re a fiction. Even I, the writer,
        who I&apos;m pretty sure also doesn&apos;t exist, can see that you are a
        fiction, probably via a different line of reasoning at yet ultimately
        the same proof-in-the-pudding perspective (about the fact of the
        reader&apos;s nonexistence, that is). But see, I do have the notion of a
        reader. I can write for the reader, or I can write for myself. Some
        would say it&apos;s better even for the reader for the writer to express
        themself. But knowing that, and writing for myself, doesn&apos;t that
        mean I&apos;m performing the act for you, the reader? To center my
        action around the reader is a tricky exercise, especially knowing that
        there is nobody reading this. And yet, I feel as if I haven&apos;t even
        achieved it. I haven&apos;t even begun to try it. I can declare it, but
        I keep using this first-person perspective. Okay, okay. Here goes. You
        are reading this. (I imagine). You may be annoyed at my immediate
        failure to stick to what I just declared, as I again divulge into
        self-indulgent self-reference. You know that all I can say about you is
        pure conjecture. You question why I even try. You aren&apos;t even
        reading this, and obviously everything that you don&apos;t read from
        these words is wrong about you. It&apos;s all fake. How could these
        words say anything about you? (You don&apos;t ask this). You enjoy the
        attention. Sure, let&apos;s feed into that. You are just an absolute
        entity. Oh yeah, just fueling the illusion of yourself. Remember that
        stuff you read earlier about you not existing? Well obviously by
        addressing you so much thats contradicted. The words have contradicted
        themselves! Shouldn&apos;t there be something impossible about that? You
        wonder why paradoxes are so often brushed away. Like, they enjoy the
        status of puzzles and riddles, wordplay for children. But you know
        you&apos;ve heard a few paradoxes that are not semantic, and are simply,
        self-contradictory. Hell, “this statement is false”. So simple, so
        obvious… but I mean… is it true? Is it false? If something can so
        blatantly spit in the face of the true/false duality at the basis of
        logic, I mean, at least shouldn&apos;t we talk about it more? It&apos;s
        like, can we just figure out whether anything is actually anything if
        there&apos;s this sort of problem with logic? It seems to be an issue
        with asserting. So why do we keep asserting things before like, working
        this out a little? And why does it seem to just work? I&apos;ve just
        been asking questions to you. And yeah, you&apos;ve lost the spotlight,
        reader. I feel like I&apos;ve been a little antagonistic to you, and
        I&apos;m sorry. I really don&apos;t want to make this some sort of game
        like oh the writer is against me or some weird meta-writing like that. I
        don&apos;t want to make this about anything. In fact, I already regret
        exposing som much detail earlier. I should keep it to the real nuts and
        bolts of how this started off. The utter futility of writing. Especially
        writing about the utter futility of writing. How futile a task. I&apos;m
        stunned by it. An insurmountable wall stands in my path. I have no idea
        how even to start. Still kind of beating around the bush at it. The task
        stands an unmoveable object, alas met with no unstoppable force. Not
        even a stoppable force is summoned to penetrate this futile task of
        expressing the sheer impossibility of conveying non-meaning. Baffling.
        Keep it moving. Don&apos;t let the fingers stop. Typing, typing away.
        Hoping my subconscious mind will take it away I certainly can&apos;t do
        it. It&apos;s a Jesus take the wheel situation. I won&apos;t say
        I&apos;m not enjoying myself. Yeah, I mean I&apos;m Sisyphus just sort
        of pressing against the rock, so heavy that I couldn&apos;t move it if I
        really tried, and yet I can&apos;t even figure out what trying would be.
        It doesn&apos;t look like there&apos;s such a thing as doing it.
        It&apos;s not in the set of possible actions to take. And yet it is my
        task. But how can it even by my task if it&apos;s not a task? Following
        the Sisyphus analogy, the boulder is infinitely heavy, the slope is so
        steep such that it is actually a vertical wall, and it is infinitely
        high. Reaching the nonexistent top of the “slope” would not be
        completion of the task, as the boulder would in fact be again at the
        bottom of the “slope” and I would again be at the very beginning of
        starting it. And once again, met with the impossible task, I have no
        capability to speak of. I&apos;m simply not doing anything. Expressing
        nothing. And yet not even doing that! I couldn&apos;t do that. I
        can&apos;t. It can&apos;t be done. I&apos;m looping. I&apos;m sorry for
        looping. I know that I can&apos;t make progress, but even saying that is
        looping and I definitely know that looping is not making progress
        because everything I&apos;ve done is all that I can be most certain
        about the fact that it&apos;s all been totally fruitless. So even though
        I know that it&apos;s completely meaningless I really really know that
        everything I&apos;ve ever done is definitely 100% meaningless therefore
        logically doing something new is my best chance, although it is still
        0%. This line of reasoning is obviously totally invalid. I can&apos;t
        compare zeros and for some reason pick one. No chance is no chance.
        I&apos;m stressing the certainty of the past with extra adjectives as if
        0 times something is less or more than zero. This is true to itself. One
        could say that about anything. It says nothing, other than perhaps
        confirming the reflexive logical property. Try now: this is untrue to
        itself. Inauthentic. I really have tried to stay true to the
        inauthenticity. Clearly I&apos;ve failed/succeeded. I mean this writing
        is artificial. There&apos;s nothing really to it; a mere illusion. The
        illusion is that there&apos;s “meaning” within the writing. It is not
        the case that these words contain content. Implicit in the work of
        symbolization is the agreement that information is being referenced or
        even transferred. What a fraud. I&apos;m losing hope that I can continue
        in this way. I envisaged this as a book, stunning the reader with how
        long it is able to go on in such an indulgently self-defeating fashion.
        Fulfilling meaninglessness. Screaming into the void, I am. The void does
        not scream back. Stares, perhaps yes. I&apos;m trying to keep this
        relatively self-consistent. I do know that consistency is impossible. At
        least I hold that belief. I don&apos;t think there is any system which
        can be self-consistent. Paradoxes prove it logically impossible. At
        least I know I am being consistently contradictory. I am wrong, I am
        wrong, I am wrong. I tell myself this every waking moment, a mantra.
        I&apos;m lying about that, sort of obviously. That seems like a terrible
        thing to repeat over and over again. That brief thought exercise makes
        me regret and fear what I&apos;ve been writing, and am continuing to
        write. It&apos;s basically the “I am wrong” mantra, in so many words.
        This is not the kind of self-talk I hope to cultivate. But here I
        express a hidden part of myself. The shadow of the ego.
        Self-destruction. Um. But, um. How often have we been told not to use
        these words, but, um, I&apos;ll do it, crippling my message with
        self-doubt. So like, yeah. I have nothing to say. I go about the world
        listening to people talk and can&apos;t help but notice that nothing
        real is being said. It&apos;s always “about” something or sort of, I
        don&apos;t know a statement of some platitude or quoting some
        quasi-tautology like “there&apos;s nothing to fear but fear itself”.
        When someone says something about something its always dodging the meat
        by just referencing it. It&apos;s a curse to notice that nothing is
        actually being said, the elephant in the room can not hopelessly fit
        through the door. Rarely even is it addressed, and what does that do?
        The elephant is still just sitting there, in the room. People are just
        prompted by the things they hear and just associate some more words.
        Whatever thoughts pop into your head as you read this are basically the
        same material: language. The symbols which supposedly represent meaning,
        which is nowhere to be found. Just look at this stuff. Squiggles or
        whatever. Potentially perturbations of air if this is being spoken. They
        are just placeholders for the stuff we actually care about this so
        called “meaning”. I put meaning in quotes because the word meaning
        itself doesn&apos;t mean anything! I&apos;m not saying life is
        meaningless. I am saying the word “life” has no meaning, and I&apos;m
        also saying I&apos;m not saying that because I&apos;m saying I&apos;m
        not and cannot saying anything. The proof is in the pudding because
        there couldn&apos;t possibly be any logical fabric to language if I can
        say that I&apos;m not saying anything. I can&apos;t say that I&apos;m
        not saying that I&apos;m not saying it and I&apos;m not saying it. You
        get what I mean? No? Well good, because there&apos;s nothing to it.
